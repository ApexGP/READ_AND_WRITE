## 英语写作

---

### 一、概述

- 英语写作分为应用文与读后续写两部分，其中应用文主要以`议论文`为主，占`15`分；读后续写则以`记叙文`为主，占`25`分
- 在考试过程中，你应该清晰地感觉到，整个写作部分的重心在`读后续写`，它直接决定了整张试卷能否达到一个较高的分数。尽管这一部分的写作难度较大，但是并非无迹可寻，读后续写是有模板的

<text style="font-size: 14px;">***注：在本篇指南中如果你碰到生词，出于编排原因，请自行查阅***</text> 

### 二、应用文 

- 根据本人高中三年的考试情况，`95%`的概率是考察议论文的写作能力，书面载体通常为*建议信*、*介绍信*或者*辩论文*
- 从写作结构上看，`建议信`与`辩论文`类似，分为三段论

``` markdown
essay
  |
  |———— beginning (50 words)
  |
  |———— body (100 words)
  |      |———— opinion I
  |      |———— opinion II
  |      |———— opinion III
  |
  |———— summary (20 ~ 30 words)
```

#### 2.1. beginning (首段)
首先，使用标准句式引入要探讨的话题，例如

``` markdown
# 从社会影响入手，由大及小
- In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of <topic> has sparked widespread debate, prompting us to reconsider our traditional beliefs and explore new perspectives.
- As society continues to progress, few issues have sparked as much controversy as <topic>, challenging the way we view <related concept>.
# 从普遍观点切入，由一般到特殊
- Throughout history, the idea that <general belief or idea> has been widely accepted, yet recent events have raised doubts about its validity in the modern context.
- It is often said that <common belief>, but as we delve deeper into the complexities of <topic>, it becomes evident that this viewpoint may no longer hold true.
# 从事实切入，反思现象
- While many assume that <common assumption>, recent studies suggest that <contrasting viewpoint>, which compels us to rethink our stance on <topic>.
- What seems like an obvious conclusion at first glance ———— <simple statement> ———— becomes increasingly complicated upon closer examination, particularly in relation to <specific aspect of the topic>.
# 激发思考的对比引入
- On the surface, <topic> may appear to be a straightforward issue, yet beneath the surface, it is a complex matter that demands careful scrutiny and thoughtful analysis.
- At first glance, the issue of <topic> may seem trivial, but when we consider <relevant factor>, it becomes clear that its implications are far-reaching and deserve a deeper exploration.
# 展现问题的紧迫性
- With <global trend or issue> becoming an increasingly pressing concern, it is vital that we examine the implications of <topic> and assess whether our current approach is sufficient.
- In light of recent developments, the question of <topic> has never been more urgent, compelling us to reconsider long-standing assumptions and take action.
# 反思历史或传统引入
- Historically, <topic> has been regarded as [traditional view], yet as we navigate the complexities of the modern world, this perception is being called into question.
- For centuries, <topic> has been viewed through the lens of [traditional perspective], but as new challenges emerge, it is crucial that we re-evaluate our stance.
```

e.g. 如果作文核心话题是关于 AI 发展的前景，可以这么开头

> As the world faces an *Artificial Intelligence* development of unprecedented proportions, the debate over <u>specific issue</u> has never been more urgent, demanding immediate attention and decisive action.

通过这样的话题引入，即突出了紧迫性，又具有一定的文采和深度，简洁有力，快速抓住老师的眼球


#### 2.2. body (正文) 
这里一般是输出观点的部分，没有什么固定句式和模板，只能通过具体的题目来分析，这样才能灵活应对考场。这几年的高考真题，都有增加冷门话题考察比例的趋势，目的是增强对考生现场组织语言与观点的能力的考察，而非预设好的模板套用。因此，我不再在这部分给出一些模板，而是提几点建议，你可以根据自己的实际情况进行实践

- **合理利用试卷资源**：相比于自己寻找阅读材料，出题人对于阅读材料的筛选基本满足你对`词汇`、`文章结构`、`观点表达`的要求。在平时做英语卷子时，多关注阅读题的文本材料，五篇阅读中至少有 2 ~ 3 篇属于议论文或科普文，都是对当下新兴的产业、科技、文艺现象进行介绍或者剖析，其中有不少新鲜、细致的观点表达和长难句的应用，可以积累下来。前者可以在遇到类似作文话题时进行化用，后者则可以对其中的内容进行改写，做到举一反三
- **必要的观点积累**：“创意来自于重复”，对于大多数学生而言，想要频繁地产出新的观点和立意是不符合规律的事情。因此，观点积累就成为绕不开的事情。除了我上面提到的试卷中的阅读材料，一些英语周报或者英语杂志也是不错的选择，它们的优点是利于订阅、时效性高并且阅读难度适中。例如：《英语文摘》、《英语沙龙》
- **合理安排观点结构**：很显然，在如今行文结构趋于固定、文章遣词造句趋于雷同的考试背景下，观点的安排就成为一个容易被忽视的得分点。观点的展示绝对不止简单的平铺，还可以<u>欲扬先抑</u>、<u>先古后今</u>、<u>平行交叉</u> ······ 甚至有些命题要求考生在 `advantages` 和 `disadvantages` 中二选一进行表达，此时就要合理运用 *Linking words* (即连接词)

``` markdown
# 表示顺序
Firstly, Secondly, Then, Afterwards, Subsequently, Last but not least, Finally 
# 表示递进
Moreover/Furthermore, In addition, What's more, Besides, Not only ... but also ..., As well as
# 表示转折
However, On the other hand, In contrast, Nevertheless/Nonetheless, Although/Though, Whereas
# 表示因果
As a result, Therefore, Thus, Hence, Consequently, Due to, Owing to
# 表示举例
For example/instance, Such as, To illustrate, In particular, Namely
# 表示强调
Indeed, In fact, Clearly, Undoubtedly
```

#### 2.3. summary (结尾)
这一段的重要性完全不输首段，其主要原因为阅卷老师经过大量批卷产生视觉疲劳、注意力下降，为了满足快速阅读的需要，人本能地会更加注意首段和结尾以便于对文本内容形成基础印象。因此，有以下两点建议

- 使用明显的提示词，告知阅卷老师此为结尾段。常见的提示词有：

``` markdown
# 表示总结
In conclusion, In summary, Overall, To sum up, All in all
```

e.g. 还是以 AI 的话题为例
> In conclusion, it is clearly that AI has reached its breaking point of development, as a result, brand new technical protocol and moral restriction require further consideration and evaluation.

- 对首段进行呼应，可以是对首段的主题`重申`起到强调作用，也可以是对首段的观点`递进`阐述，这取决于你首段是如何引入写作中心的：（1）开门见山，直接给出`建设性`观点；（2）`综述性`引出总体观点，立场清晰但是不够具体

#### 2.4. sample (范文)
还是以 AI 为话题，下面给出一个示例，方便你总体把握行文节奏。文章题目是围绕学生大量使用AI来辅助学习和生活这一现象表述自己的观点：

``` markdown
Artificial intelligence (AI), which has become increasingly `prevalent` in recent years, significantly transforms how students `approach` both their academic studies and daily lives. Among various AI applications, tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot `stand out`, as they offer `considerable` advantages, particularly in enhancing efficiency, enabling `personalized` learning, and `granting` instant access to extensive information.

<Firstly>, AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude enable students to efficiently complete their tasks since they can promptly respond to questions and clearly explain complicated concepts that would otherwise require considerable effort to `grasp`. By offering real-time assistance, these AI tools help learners save valuable time, which can be devoted instead to deeper study or creative thinking.

<Secondly>, personalized learning becomes `feasible` through AI's ability to adjust explanations and tasks according to individual students’ strengths and weaknesses. For example, Copilot significantly assists students who are studying programming by proposing `tailored` coding suggestions, allowing learners to progress at their own pace, and therefore making education accessible to a wider range of students with varied learning styles.

<However>, it is `crucial` for students to `remain` mindful that although these AI tools provide numerous benefits, responsible usage is necessary to prevent `excessive` dependence, which could `undermine` critical thinking and independent learning skills.

<In conclusion>, the intelligent integration of AI tools into students' daily routines and educational practices holds `immense` potential. As long as learners `consciously` maintain a balance between relying on these digital assistants and `fostering` their own intellectual independence, AI will unquestionably continue to positively `reshape` education, making it both more effective and accessible.
```

注意到，文章中我标红的是一些“高级”词汇（其实你都认识，只是还不知道可以这么表达出来，即 **collocation**），而标蓝的则是我在第二部分强调过的 **Linking words**，你可以留意。

那么现在，为了检验你是否掌握了以上技巧，请你从分别从`段落结构`、`词汇丰富程度`、`句子结构`、`观点阐述`这几个角度来分析上面的范文，一些分析的模板我已在下方给出，请你完善它们：

1. `structure`
- 本篇文章采用标准的总分总行文结构，首段即开门见山点明 “AI 是提高学习效率的工具” 这一立场，body 则分为三个段落，......

- ......

2. `vocabulary`
- 本篇文章熟练地使用了同义词替换这一技巧，较好地避免了在行文中由于表达意思相近而重复出现同一单词的问题，例如：significantly 和 considerable、feasible 和 accessible、......

- ......

3. `sentence`
- 在本文首段，使用了从句`which has become ...`，让句子层次感更强，修饰更灵活，同时......

- ......

- ......

4. `opinion`
- ......

- ......

- ......

### 三、读后续写

#### 3.1.知识储备
在引入读后续写之前，我们先来认识几点概念

##### 1. ==同一情景描写的多种替换表达==
注意到，这在读后续写中是一个非常重要的概念（或者说技巧），指当你经过故事情节的设计后，面对某一场景描写（如：环境、人物动作、人物对话、人物心理）可以有多种不同的表述方式，而不同的表述方式也会强调不同的侧重点。下面分别举几个例子，帮助理解：

  - 环境描写
  
  ``` markdown
  # 从句修饰，这里突出了阴郁的氛围，侧重点在 clouds
  It was a cold, gloomy morning, with clouds <hanging heavily> in the sky.
  # 客体主语化，突出了清晨的刺骨，对比常规写法更加生动也更简洁（我在下面再解释为什么）
  The morning air was brisk and biting, <shrouded> in mist.
  # 在拟人化的基础上，引入比喻或者夸张的手法，第一句里 `crept` 有“像蠕虫一样蠕动的意思”，请你自己赏析第二句并对比一般写法
  A grey dawn <crept> slowly over the sleeping town.
  Morning arrived quietly, <blanketed> in a layer of dense fog.
  ```

  - 人物动作描写
  
  ``` markdown
  # “先总后分”，即先描写人物主要动作，然后通过从句细化人物某个部位的状态；例如这里对眼睛使用 `scanning` 呼应了 `cautiously`
  He walked into the room cautiously, eyes <scanning> every corner.
  # 动词细化，即通过更形象的动词而非副词修饰来增强画面感；这里 `slipped` 替代 `walked`，而 `alert` 则“升级”了事情的严重性，突出了人物提防的心理
  He <slipped> quietly into the room, <alert> for any sudden movement.
  # 利用忽略主语的宾语前置，弱化了进入房间的动作，而强调了谨慎这一人物心理，同时让句子结构变得更加紧凑
  <Entering> carefully, he <surveyed> the room with cautious eyes.
  # 去动作化表达，即把动作描写拆分为名词 (noun) +形容词 (adj.)，虽然牺牲了一些画面感，但是丰富了表达方式，这里的 `movements` 就起到这样的作用
  He stepped into the room, <movements> deliberate and wary.
  ```

  - 人物语言描写

  ``` markdown
  # 使用更细分的动词，第一句使用 `whispered` 代替 `said`，第二句则使用 `murmured`
  “I don’t think this is a good idea,” she <whispered> nervously. 
  “Maybe we should reconsider this,” she <murmured> anxiously.
  # 在句首或句中补充描述
  She hesitated, her voice barely <audible>: “I'm not so sure about this...”
  <With doubt> in her voice, she quietly suggested, “Should we really be doing this?”
  ```

  - 人物心理描写

  ``` markdown
  # 以 `heart` 为主语
  His heart <pounded>, `filled with` uncertainty.
  # 情绪主语化（这个技巧再次出现），并运用夸张的手法
  <Waves of anxiety> `washed over` him, making his stomach `churn`.
  # 句首添加从句
  He felt an uneasy `knot` forming inside, fear <gripping> tightly at his chest.
  His mind <raced> with doubts, each thought <amplifying> his anxiety.
  ```

##### 2. ==客体主语化==
在上个概念中，列出了一些增强细节描写的句子，注意到，其中有一半的句子通过让 **“情绪”、“环境”** 作主语，加强了感染力的同时也变相方便`遣词造句`。为什么说方便 `遣词造句`，我们来举个心理描写的例子：

  - 传统写法下，动词的选择是有限的，情绪只能通过 `feel`、`find`、`think` 这些笼统的动词作为媒介传递，不是说不能使用而是考虑到记叙文（或者短篇）的文体，在文章立意的基础上更加强调文本本身的文字张力

  ``` markdown
  She <felt> very nervous as she stood up to speak.
  ```

  - 现在我们来对比一下在客体主语化写法下，句子的结构以及动词的选择。注意到，这里`nervousness`作为主语，通过 “**紧紧扼住喉咙**” 来表现女主人公紧张得说不出话了。这里的张力是通过蓝色部分的动词短语呈现出来的，==grip==一词足以体现紧张程度之深，在大部分时候这是副词无法达到的效果

  ``` markdown
  Nervousness <tightened its grip> around her throat as she rose to speak.
  ```

再举个环境描写的例子，请你自己感受两种写法带来的场景冲击力与句子结构的不同：

  - 传统写法
  
  ``` markdown
  It was raining <heavily> outside, and the sky was grey.
  ```

  - 客体主语化

  ``` markdown
  Heavy rain <hammered relentlessly> against the window, under a sky <cloaked in> depressing grey.
  ```

##### 3. ==情节构思策略与技巧==
在读后续写中，情节构思是一个非常重要的环节，直接决定了你能否顺利地完成续写。这里我给出一些常见的情节构思技巧，供你参考：

1. **情节发展**：情节的发展应该是合理的，符合逻辑的，避免突兀的转折和不合常理的情节发展。可以通过==设置冲突==、人物关系的变化等方式来推动情节的发展。
2. **人物塑造**：人物的性格、动机和行为应该是==连贯==的（注意：<u>**这非常重要，续写前后人物不能出现割裂感**</u>），人物之间的关系也应该随着情节的发展而变化。可以通过`对话`、`内心独白`等方式来展示人物的心理变化。
3. **环境描写**：环境的描写可以为情节的发展提供背景和氛围，增强故事的代入感。
4. **情感渲染**：通过人物的情感变化来推动情节的发展，可以让读者更容易产生共鸣。
5. **结尾设计**：结尾应该给读者留下深刻的印象，可以通过总结、反思、启示等方式来结束故事。结尾的设计要与故事的主题和情节发展相呼应，避免生硬的结束方式。
6. **时间线索**：在续写中，时间的流逝和事件的先后顺序是非常重要的，使用时间副词、时间状语从句等方式来明确时间线索。

下面我再给出两个情节构思的策略：

- 策略一：“==因果链==”

  ``` markdown
  事件或困难出现 -> 人物内心的反应与挣扎 -> 人物做出决定 -> 决定带来新的局面或冲突
  ```

  以“考试紧张”为例：
  
  ``` markdown
  As he sat down, a sudden panic rose within him (`困难出现`). His breathing quickened, and memories of past failures flooded his mind (`内心挣扎`). He closed his eyes tightly, took a deep breath, and told himself it was just another test (`人物做出决定`). Gradually, his panic subsided, replaced by a determination he had rarely felt before (`新的局面`).
  ```

- 策略二：“==情绪转折==”

  ``` markdown
  初始情绪（负面） -> 转折事件发生 -> 新情绪（正面） -> 人物行动或情节延伸
  ```

  以“舞台恐惧”为例：

  ``` markdown
  Fear gripped her tightly as she stepped onto the brightly lit stage, her hands trembling slightly (`初始情绪`). Yet, amidst the sea of unfamiliar faces, she suddenly spotted her mother's encouraging smile (`转折事件`). Warmth filled her heart, fear gradually replaced by confidence (`新情绪`). Smiling bravely, she began her performance, each note clearer and stronger than the last (`行动延伸`).
  ```

#### 3.2 行文结构
在上一部分，我介绍了三个关键的读后续写核心概念，下面我们来看看读后续写的行文结构。在考试中，我通常建议你采用常规结构，即：
  
  ``` markdown
  读后续写 (200词-250词)
    |
    |———— 第一段 (约100词)
    |      |———— 明确衔接给出情境与原文
    |      |———— 深入人物内心活动，揭示内心冲突或想法
    |
    |———— 第二段 (100词-150词)
           |———— 人物采取行动或情绪发生转折
           |———— 推动事件至高潮并顺利收尾，点出主旨或升华内涵
  ```

下面我给出一个示例，以高考真题中常见的“帮助陌生人”为话题帮助你理解行文结构的安排：

  ``` markdown
  # 第一段
  明确表达主人公看到陌生人需要帮助，心中产生犹豫挣扎的过程，比如担心被骗、害怕尴尬等心理活动细致刻画，呈现其内心的复杂情绪
  
  # 第二段
  通过对陌生人微笑、点头等肢体语言的描写，表现出主人公内心的转变，最终决定帮助陌生人。描写行动过程中和帮助后的内心感受，深化主旨，表现善意的力量或人性的美好
  ```

你可以就这个话题练习一下，先不追求语法和用词，试着沿着这条逻辑线索写出一段续写，注意要有`情节发展`、`人物内心活动`、`人物行动`、`情感渲染`等元素。

  - 这里我给出大概的流程，请你参考并自己扩写成两段，写在下面：

  ``` markdown
  As she walked down the street, she noticed a stranger struggling with a heavy bag. A part of her wanted to help, but another part hesitated, fearing it might be a scam(`犹豫`). She took a deep breath, reminding herself that kindness was never wasted. With a smile, she approached the stranger and offered her assistance(`下定决心`). The stranger's face lit up with gratitude, and together they managed to lift the bag. In that moment, she felt a warmth in her heart, realizing that helping others not only lightened their burden but also brought joy to her own life(`感受`).
  ```

  ``` markdown
  AS she walked down the street,






  The stranger's face lit up with gratitude,






  ```

#### 3.3 词汇的选择

这一部分是 ==**3.1**== 中提到的“同一情景描写的多种替换表达”的延伸，除了掌握写法上面的技巧还要知道如何打造更形象的描写，下面我给出一些常见的词汇替换及它们的中文意思，帮助你在续写中丰富表达
